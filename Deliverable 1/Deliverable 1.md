### Unique Purpose:

Throughout various semesters in the IS department, different classes become more popular and become unavailable quickly. This means that some students will be waitlisted and may never be able to take that class, forcing them to take courses that they are not interested in. In most cases, the head of the IS department will have to find another staff member to teach the popular class many students request. The issue with this is that this process is time-consuming and may finalize before classes start, disrupting many schedules that were already pre-built.  

### Solution:  

We plan to build a voting system that will provide more insight into what classes need prioritization ahead of time (One Year). 

Students will vote before the end of every semester for what classes they would want next year.

Steps for a student to vote:
The voter would need to log into a website/software we develop on a device
From there, the voter would submit their CAMPUS ID
Once their identity is verified, the voter can complete their ballot and securely submit their vote(s) to the web application ballot box
At the end the total count for what class is given.
Make sure passwords and votes are encrypted with a secure hashing mechanism.
Project budget: $60,000

### High-Level-overview
The website greets student, asks them to enter campus ID
Authenticates student ID
Website will then introduce the student to the multiple classes that are going to be offered (One year before)
The student has two votes they can use
They click on whatever class they would like to take
After a week, the voting systems goes offline.
The voting system will take the results and output them in various ways
Graphs, Charts,
The voting system will track all votes to see if there is a trend over the years
The website will allow students to enter any input for what they’d like to add to the voting system 
Such as adding specific programs to computer labs (MS Project, etc)
Machine learning to scan keywords/the most common inputs to save time for the director of information Systems. 

### System Request-Class Poll System

Project Sponsor: Sreedevi Sampath, Associate Professor, Director of Undergraduate Programs, University of Maryland Baltimore County

Business Need: This project has been initiated to create an efficient means of meeting the demands of classes and assigning professors to classes that received majority votes for the classes. 

Business Requirements: Using this system from our website, students can cast votes on classes for the following year. Website access is limited to UMBC students who are majoring in Information Systems. Database of valid CampusIDs (IS Students) which will be cross-checked to a database of students who will graduate prior to instating the classes. Once votes reach the deadline, the votes will be ranked by most votes, and the client will use the data to assign professors to meet the demands.  

Business Value: The system will improve the planning process for assigning professors to teach classes that meet the demands of IS students and decreases the margin of error in overallocating and underallocating classes.   

Special Issues or Constraints: The voting system results will affect the available classes for one year after the semester that the results came in. Students graduating before the time that the classes up for voting are made available will not be able to vote.        


###  Feasibility Analysis (Including all elements) 

The project team has conducted a feasibility analysis as part of the evaluation process for the Information Systems Voting Project. To help identify the risks associated with the project, we will identify the important risks associated with the project by analyzing the technical, economic, and organizational feasibility of the project. 

###  Technical Feasibility:

As we are familiar with the concept and development of a voting system, less risk will be put onto the success of the project. While evaluating the technical feasibility of this project, we also looked at the project size of the task. Assigning two developers to the project, data analyst, systems analyst, security engineer, and security engineer will provide our team more than enough time to produce this project successfully. As this project does not require integration with many other complex systems, the overall project complexity is meager. We have also analyzed UMBC’s class registration system and believe our product will integrate flawlessly with the structure. Speaking with external IT consultants further supported our economic feasibility analysis. As with many programs and website development, bugs and kinks will have to be worked out. This leads us to implement a two-week testing phase where the program will be heavily used and monitored by our own team members to attempt and fix any bugs we discover. Overall, this project produces a low-risk technical risk, and we believe we can build and maintain the voting system requirements described above. 

### Economic Feasibility 
	During our economic feasibility analysis, we will be calculating the overall costs of our Information Systems Voting Project. We’ve estimated the amount of this project to come up to $71,000. We estimated that about $7,000 of the amount is for any risk complications in the project that may occur. Capital resource costs would cost $30,000 when implementing this due to the extensive amount of work that needs to be done. $20,000 of this project would go to the framework, project investment and common assessment. $14,000 will be benefited from this project. Benefits of this project would be the first 90 days would free as a trial process. 

### Organizational Feasibility:
During our organizational feasibility analysis, we will analyze the potential interest for the voting system. For our top management support, The IS department director Dr. Sampath supports our project. We consider Arian Eidizadeh as our project champion. He is an enthusiastic and knowledgeable project manager. From an organizational management perspective, all team members support the project idea and think it will help IS department become more efficient in its class planning phase and will also help students get into their desired classes. An organizational risk while developing this project can include the system not specifically being up to par with the department standard or director doesn’t agree with a certain implementation. To mitigate this risk, we will develop several modules of critical functions. 
To mitigate other risks, we plan to develop multiple safeguards and implement them within the voting system on a case by case basis. UMBC information system students and the Information System Director will be our target customers for this project. Customers will expect a website that is helpful and easy to navigate. Students will sign up for the voting website using their campus ID and can use their account for every semester. Students will also be able to view voting results on the website after the department declares the result in various visual formats. However, that will be up to the Information Systems Director as they will have administrator rights on the voting system. Ultimately, the voting system will help the director visualize the most wanted classes (the most votes for specific classes), which will help make a decision based on the results.  

### Project Methodology

The first step is to create a web interface to greet guests as they enter the website. This would be done through HTML, Javascript, or the like. 
Also work on the authentication, to make sure it is connected to the server as need be. If authentication isn’t working, we should view the server, user input and authentication to make sure everything is working. 
Display confirmation page when the user successfully logs in
Display Classes with schedule and time slots for each class. 
A selection process should allow students to select 2 classes out of the list
The selection process should not allow more than 2 clicks on the selection portion of the page
A week after the voting system is uploaded it is taken off the  website
Display the results in charts and graphs
graphs and charts in the background
The trend is produced from the given data
Comment section is given for feedback on voting system
Ex. (include ms project, class times, professors, etc…)
Machine learning used to scan data



### Agile Development:

A group of programming-centric methodologies that focus on streamlining the SDLC. Much of the modeling and documentation overhead is eliminated; instead, face-to-face communication is preferred. A project emphasizes simple, iterative application development in which every iteration is a complete software project, including planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, and documentation (Figure 2-8). Cycles are kept short (1–4 weeks), and the development team focuses on adapting to the current business environment. 

Scrum has some similarities with XP, including small teams, a series of iterations (called sprints), and a focus on building the system one small piece at a time. Scrum teams obtain requirements at the start of a project or a sprint, then self-organize and form backlogs containing their planned approach to the project. The scrum master plays an important role in guiding the team’s progress through the backlogs with repeated sprints. The essential features are built and delivered in the first sprint; additional features are included in subsequent sprints.

We plan to use a Scrum Agile development methodology for our Information Systems Voting Project. We plan to split our team up into smaller units and assign tasks to each unit. These teams include:

### Team 1 to talk with students and project workers on the front end
Implement the front face of the website where it asks you for login
Any issues with the system will be addressed before it is made live
Implement project Idea using HTML or Javascript
Can work on any device (ios, android, windows, linux, Mac OS, etc….)

### Team 2 to work on the back end server
Server of class names should be available on the website
It should be implemented in My-SQL 
If authentication isn’t working, we should view the server, user input, and authentication to make sure everything is working
SQL lines should process fast enough for the display to recognize it
The server should have read and write capabilities so that it can be altered later on by different people in the team
Ensure authentication, protocols, and software used are all up-to-date and secure

### Team 3 to work on output and maintenance
Ensure only 2 selections are made per person 
Ensure that the website is only working for current students who haven’t applied for graduation
Graphs, Charts and Trends should be worked in and implemented using Microsoft project
Machine learning should be used to scan the data and automate most of the operations
Charts should be in  a printable format

### All Teams Will work together to:
Ensure the website is taken off the week after voting is completed
Make sure the comment section works, ex. (include ms project, class times, professors, etc…)
Make sure everything runs properly before it is fully deployed
Notify users so that they can experience the website and give immediate feedback
Monitor the website for the first 2 weeks of deployment to ensure the website is running smoothly
Ensure there are no loopholes or vulnerabilities within the voting system
No SQL attacks, or XSS-based attacks are available on the UMBC sign in interface.
